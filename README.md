# Grape - Graph Rewriting and Persistence Engine 

A Clojure library designed to provide support for graph rewriting based on a persistent graph store.

## Rule definition

Graph rewriting rules are defined using the 'rule' form. Rules consist of three parts:
- the _read_ specifies the graph pattern to be matched in the host graph
- the _delete_ part specifies which graph elements from the matched host graph should be deleted
- the _create_ part specifies which graph elements should be created when the rule is applied

### Example 1: A simple rule to create one node
The following rule creates only one node. It has an empty _read_ and _delete_ part, so it matches any host graph and deletes nothing.

```clojure
(rule { :create 
          (pattern 
            (node 'n {:label 'Person :asserts {:name "Jens"}}))}))
```
The 'node' form is used to specify the node to be created. Note that Grape currently supports only one (optional) type label for nodes, but multiple (optional) property assigments (assert).

### Example 2: A simple rule with a _reader_
The the next rule has a _read_ as well as a _create_ part. Two nodes of type _Person_ are matched and connected with a newly created edge.

```clojure
(rule {:read (pattern 
                (node 'f {:label 'Person :asserts {:name "Flo"}})
                (node 'j {:label 'Person :asserts {:name "Jens"}}))
       :create (pattern 
                  (edge 'e {:label 'parent_of :src 'j :tar 'f} ))}))
```

### Example 3: This example create a bit more

```clojure
(rule {:read (pattern 
                (node 'f {:label 'Person :asserts {:name "Flo"}})
                (node 'j {:label 'Person :asserts {:name "Jens"}}))
       :create (pattern 
                (node 'a {:label 'Person :asserts {:name "Anke"}})
                (edge 'e1 {:label 'works_for :src 'f :tar 'a} )
                (edge 'e2 {:label 'works_for :src 'j :tar 'j} )
               )}))
```
### Example 4: A rule with _delete_

This rule also deletes matched graph elements.

```clojure
(rule  { :read (pattern
                  (node 'n1)
                  (node 'n2)
                  (edge 'e {:label 'works_for :src 'n1 :tar 'n2}))
         :delete ['e]
         :create (pattern
                  (node 'n3 {:label 'Role :asserts {:name 'work}})
                  (edge 'e1 {:label 'offers :src 'n3 :tar 'n2})
                  (edge 'e2 {:label 'takes :src 'n3 :tar 'n1}))}))
```

## Rule semantics

# Matching
Grape will by default attempt to find an isomorphic match of the _reader_ pattern in the host graph. Consider the application of the our above rewrite rule (example 4) on the followig host graph.

![graph1](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1776629/13522111/3d4e4956-e1a2-11e5-9d07-043e0ede3860.png)

The rule replaces 'works_for' edges with a node and two new edges. Given the (default) isomorphic matching semantics, the rule is applicable only once, namely on the edge between _Flo_ and _Anke_. The following figure shows the result of that rule application.

![graph2](https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1776629/13522256/4c579154-e1a3-11e5-9e50-e8cf62cd04ed.png)

If we want to allow homomorphic matches, we can choose that option in the pattern definition of the rule's _read_ clause. The following modification of example rule 4 does the trick.

```clojure
(rule  { :read (pattern :homo
                  (node 'n1)
                  (node 'n2)
                  (edge 'e {:label 'works_for :src 'n1 :tar 'n2}))
         :delete ['e]
         :create (pattern
                  (node 'n3 {:label 'Role :asserts {:name 'work}})
                  (edge 'e1 {:label 'offers :src 'n3 :tar 'n2})
                  (edge 'e2 {:label 'takes :src 'n3 :tar 'n1}))}))
```
The homomorphic option allows nodes _n1_ and _n2_ in the reader pattern to map to the _same_ node in the host graph, resulting in the following rewritten graph:

# Deletions
Grape supports different semantics when it comes to node deletions. Graph rewriting may be based on different theories. The most well known are based on category theory. The so-called Double Pushout (DPO) approach does not allow "dangling" edges when nodes are deleted. The so-called Single Pushout (SPO) approach resolves edges that are left "dangling" when nodes are deleted by deleting those edges as well. Grape supports both approaches, with SPO being the default. The approach used for executing a partiular rule can be specified with the _:theory_ keyword. For example, the DPO rule below applied to the most recent graph above will through an exception as it would result in dangling edges when node _f_ is deleted.
```clojure
(rule {:theory 'dpo
       :read (pattern 
               (node 'f {:label 'Person :asserts {:name "Flo"}}))
       :delete ['f]})
```
