{"name":"Grape","tagline":"Graph Rewriting And Persistence Engine","body":"### Welcome to Grape.\r\nGrape is a Graph Rewriting and Persistence Engine designed as an embedded DSL in Clojure. It currently uses Neo4J as the underlying database. You can find an introduction to the concept of Graph Rewriting at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_rewriting. As opposed to many other graph rewriting tools, Grape does not have a graphical editor, but rather uses text-based input. Grape will have a graphical display for visualizing graph rewriting rules (under development). Another difference to many other graph rewriting tools is that Grape is based on a persistent database backend, i.e., the graphs are stored in a graph database. In that aspect, Grape is similar to Progres (http://www-i3.informatik.rwth-aachen.de/tikiwiki/tiki-index.php%3Fpage=Research:+Progres.html).\r\n\r\n### Development status\r\nGrape is currently in early development and far from complete. \r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nGrape is being developed by Jens Weber (@jenshweber).
